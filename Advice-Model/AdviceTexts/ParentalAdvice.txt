Go ask your father.
Don't do drugs.
Never quit.
Eat your vegetables.
Be home before dinner.
You are your own person.
It's time you moved out.
Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
Don't drink, don't do drugs.
Don't spend all your time worrying about others.
Be nice to everyone.
Eat your broccoli.
Don't go to class on Monday.
Don't judge a book by it's cover.
Be on time.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
